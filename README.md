Static RAM board for the Tandy Color Computer 2 model 26-3134

This KiCAD project includes the schematic and PCB design for a 64k static RAM board for the
Tandy Color Computer 2 model 26-3134. It is designed to plug into the expansion port.
There are two versions of the board in this repo, the main one which is the SMD version
and there is a through hole version under "coco2_3134_64k_static_ram_board_tht".
